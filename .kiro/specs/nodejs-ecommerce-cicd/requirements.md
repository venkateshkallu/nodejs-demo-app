# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a complete Node.js e-commerce demonstration application called "Kiro" with automated CI/CD pipeline integration. The application will showcase a simple Amazon-like shopping experience with product listings, cart functionality, and responsive design. The project includes Docker containerization and GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment to DockerHub.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to view a branded Kiro shopping website, so that I can browse products in a professional e-commerce environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display "Kiro — Smart Shopping Made Simple" as the page title
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL show "Welcome to Kiro" as the main heading
3. WHEN a user views the site THEN the system SHALL contain no Lovable branding, labels, or watermarks
4. WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL display a clean, professional Kiro-branded interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a shopper, I want to view product listings with images and prices, so that I can browse available items and make purchasing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the product showcase section THEN the system SHALL display product cards with image, name, and price
2. WHEN a product card is rendered THEN the system SHALL include an "Add to Cart" button for each product
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL show example products like "HP Laptop" priced at "₹49,999"
4. WHEN viewed on different devices THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive layout using CSS Flexbox or Grid
5. WHEN a user interacts with product cards THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Node.js backend server, so that the application can serve content and handle requests efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL run on Express.js framework
2. WHEN no port is specified THEN the system SHALL default to port 3000
3. WHEN a user requests the root path THEN the system SHALL serve the index.html file
4. WHEN static files are requested THEN the system SHALL serve them from the public directory
5. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL log "Kiro server running on port [PORT]"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Docker containerization, so that the application can be deployed consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the Docker image THEN the system SHALL use Node.js version 18 as base image
2. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL expose port 3000
3. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL exclude node_modules and npm-debug.log files
4. WHEN the container runs THEN the system SHALL execute "node app.js" as the main command
5. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL copy package files first for optimal caching

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipeline, so that code changes are automatically tested, built, and deployed without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL trigger GitHub Actions workflow
2. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL install dependencies using npm install
3. WHEN tests are available THEN the system SHALL execute npm test
4. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL build Docker image with latest tag
5. WHEN Docker image is built THEN the system SHALL push it to DockerHub repository
6. WHEN authenticating to DockerHub THEN the system SHALL use stored GitHub secrets for credentials

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation, so that other developers can understand, run, and contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the repository THEN the system SHALL include a detailed README.md file
2. WHEN reading documentation THEN the system SHALL explain the CI/CD pipeline process
3. WHEN following instructions THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup and deployment steps
4. WHEN reviewing the project THEN the system SHALL include screenshots of pipeline success and DockerHub image
5. WHEN accessing the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide links to live demo and DockerHub repository

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper project structure, so that the codebase is organized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project THEN the system SHALL organize files in public/, .github/workflows/, and test/ directories
2. WHEN reviewing configuration THEN the system SHALL include Dockerfile, .dockerignore, and package.json files
3. WHEN checking version control THEN the system SHALL include appropriate .gitignore file
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL include test files in test/app.test.js
5. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL have all necessary configuration files for Docker and GitHub Actions
